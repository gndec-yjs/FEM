| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1          | Briefly explain the historical development of the Finite Element Method, highlighting at least **three milestones** and their significance.                                                                        | CO2      | L2            | 4         |
| 2          | Discuss **three major applications** of FEM in civil engineering and explain why FEM is preferred over other numerical methods for those cases.                                                                    | CO3      | L2, L4        | 4         |
| 3          | Derive the **stiffness matrix** for a 1D **spring element** using Hookeâ€™s law and matrix formulation. Include a clear diagram.                                                                                     | CO1      | L3            | 6         |
| 4          | Derive the **stiffness matrix** for a 1D **bar element** using the direct approach. Mention all assumptions clearly.                                                                                               | CO1      | L3            | 6         |
| 5          | Using the **Minimum Potential Energy Principle**, formulate the FEM equation for a spring element. Show each step clearly.                                                                                         | CO1, CO2 | L3            | 5         |
| 6          | A steel bar of length 2 m, cross-section 150 mmÂ², and modulus of elasticity 200 GPa is fixed at one end and subjected to a 15 kN tensile force at the other end. Using FEM, find the displacement at the free end. | CO1, CO3 | L3, L4        | 6         |
| 7          | Explain the **Direct Stiffness Method** in your own words, and draw a simple schematic showing the procedure flow (numbering, connectivity, assembly).                                                             | CO1, CO4 | L2, L3        | 4         |
| 8          | Write the **nodal equilibrium equation** for a 2-element bar system and briefly explain the physical meaning of each term.                                                                                         | CO1      | L2            | 4         |
